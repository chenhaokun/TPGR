This code implements the TPGR model and a semi-synthetic recommendation environment.


In run_time_tools.py, mf_with_bias() is to gain embeddings of items by utilizing the PMF model; clustering_vector_constructor() is to construct item representation in order to building the balanced hierarchical clustering tree(3 types as shown in the paper).
In tpgr.py, class PRE_TRAIN, TREE and TPGR correspond to the rnn pretraining step, tree constructing step and model training step of the TPGR model.


To run the model, one should make configuration in config file and run main.py.
All parameters in config file are explained as follows.

[META]
ACTION_DIM: the embedding dimension of each action (item).
STATISTIC_DIM: the dimension of the statistic information, in our implementation, there are 9 kinds of statistic information.
REWARD_DIM: the dimension of the one-hot reward representation.
MAX_TRAINING_STEP: the maximum training steps.
DISCOUNT_FACTOR: discount factor for calculating cumulated reward.
EPISODE_LENGTH: the number of recommendation interactions of each episode.
LOG_STEP: the number of interval steps for printing evaluation logs when training the TPGR model.

[ENV]
RATING_FILE: the name of the original rating file, the rating files are stored in data/rating as default.
ALPHA: to control the ratio of the sequential reward as described in the paper.
BOUNDARY_RATING: to divide positive and negative rating.
MAX_RATING: maximum rating in the rating file.
MIN_RATING: minimum rating in the rating file.

[TPGR]
PRE_TRAINING: bool type (T/F), indicating whether conducting pretraining step.
PRE_TRAINING_STEP: the number of pretraining steps.
PRE_TRAINING_MASK_LENGTH: control the length of the historical rewards to recover when pretraining.

PRE_TRAINING_MAX_ITEM_NUM: the maximum number of items to be considered when pretraining.
PRE_TRAINING_RNN_TRUNCATED_LENGTH: rnn truncated length.
PRE_TRAINING_BATCH_SIZE: the batch size adopted in pre-training step.
PRE_TRAINING_LOG_STEP: the number of interval steps for printing evaluation logs when pre-training.

LOAD_MODEL: bool type (T/F), indicating whether loading existing model.
MODEL_LOAD_VS: the version of the model to load from.
MODEL_SAVE_VS: the version of the model to save to.

HIDDEN_UNITS: the hidden units list for each policy network, seperated by ','.
SAMPLE_EPISODES_PER_BATCH: the number of sample episodes for each user in a training batch.
SAMPLE_USERS_PER_BATCH: the number of sample users in a training batch.
EVAL_BATCH_SIZE: batch size of episodes for evaluation.
